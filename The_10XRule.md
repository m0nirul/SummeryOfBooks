# The 10X Rule by GRANT CARDONE
## CHAPTER 1
  What are the 2 parts of 10X rule?
  1. Asseting the level of efforts needed to achive your goal. (Try increasing efforts to 10 times)
  2. Adjusting my thinking I dare believe to achive things which were not possible previously. 10X way of thinking, set targets that are 10X more than you do previously
  
  The following is the basic series of mistakes people makewhen setting out to achieve goals
  1. __*Misstargetting*__ by setting goal that are too low and when achieved that disrupts the motivation
  2. Underestimating what it will take i terms of __*action, resources etc*__ to achieve the goal
  3. Spending too much time __*COMPETING*__ other than dominating the sector
  4. __*Underestimating the amount of adversity*__ they need to overcome to actually achive the goal
  
 Why is it a problem to set a goal too low?  
  >- Why spend your life making only enough money to end up with not enough money?
  >- Why work out in the gym only once a week, just to get sore and never see a change in your body type? 
  >- Why get merely “good” at something when you know the marketplace only rewards excellence? 
  >- Why work eight hours a day at a job where no one recognizes you when you could be a superstar—and perhaps even run or own the place?
  All these examples require energy.
  
  What is success?
  >Success is the degree or measure of attaining some desired object or end

  >But, Success is not merely achieving something.
  
  >Think of it this way: you wouldn’t consider a diet “successful” if you lost 10 pounds and put on 12. In other words, you have to be able to keep success—not just get it. You would also want to improve upon that success to ensure that you do maintain it.
  
  >An interesting thing about success is that it’s like a breath of air; although your last breath of air is important, it’s not nearly as important as the next one.
  
  >A person who limits his or her potential success will limit what he or she will do to create it and keep it.
  
  >When
people start limiting the amount of success they desire, I assure you
they will limit what will be required of them in order to achieve success
and will fail miserably at doing what it takes to keep it.

>As long as you are alive, you
will either live to accomplish your own goals and dreams or
be used as a resource to accomplish someone else’s.

__CHOOSE WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO BE__

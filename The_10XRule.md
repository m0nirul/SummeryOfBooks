# The 10X Rule by GRANT CARDONE
## CHAPTER 1
  What are the 2 parts of 10X rule?
  1. Asseting the level of efforts needed to achive your goal. (Try increasing efforts to 10 times)
  2. Adjusting my thinking I dare believe to achive things which were not possible previously. 10X way of thinking, set targets that are 10X more than you do previously
  
  The following is the basic series of mistakes people makewhen setting out to achieve goals
  1. __*Misstargetting*__ by setting goal that are too low and when achieved that disrupts the motivation
  2. Underestimating what it will take i terms of __*action, resources etc*__ to achieve the goal
  3. Spending too much time __*COMPETING*__ other than dominating the sector
  4. __*Underestimating the amount of adversity*__ they need to overcome to actually achive the goal
  
  Why is it a problem to set a goal too low?

# 4Ds of Time Management
- **DO**
- **Delete**
- **Defer**
- **Delegate**

## Do
Simply put `act`! Before deciding to do any task try 120 secs rule from David Allen as a decision framework.
> **The rationale for the two-minute rule is that that's more or less the point it starts taking longer to store and trackan item than to deal with it the first time it's in your hand - in other words, it's the efficiency cutoff**

Putting in simpler words, if your task takes more than 120 seconds and you still need to do it, work on this task alone for 30 mins or until you complete it
## Delete/Drop
Simply it's the art of making decission to do or delete. Many productivity consultants recommend approaching this **D** through the gaze of the Pareto Principle. Known as **The 80/20 Rule**, it states 80% of the results come from 20% of causes or activities
> So ask yourself: Will this activity help me get the long term result I/WE want?

If the deleted item is a simple activity, remove it form your to do list and move on. As the saying goes by _The second most pleasing thing after completing a to do list is removing an item from it_
